# Moderating Bug Hunting Contributions

**Reminder:** Please read the current [Utopian Rules](https://utopian.io/rules) first, to bring yourself up to date.

The [Bug Hunting](https://utopian.io/bug-hunting/review) category is very formal and follows strict rules. Bug reports need to describe the issue in a detailed but precise way. Irrelevant information should be avoided. Less is more in this category!

## What is a Bug?

It's important at this point, to give a clear definition of what Utopian considers as a bug and what not.

Bugs are unintended behaviors, that lead to malfunction and/or vulnerabilities. Layout issues, e.g. those related to responsive web design, that do not break the functionality of the website/app, can't be accepted as valid bug reports.

Also sometimes the actual intended behavior is mistaken for a bug, due to a lack of understanding of the software.

As a moderator you have to competently judge what is an actual bug and what not.

More generally speaking, bugs can be divided into the following *levels of severity*:

- Level 1: Trivial/Cosmetic
- Level 2: Unintended/Misleading Behavior
- Level 3: Critical/Complete Failure

Level 1 contributions are not eligible for the Bug Hunting category. However, if well elaborated, they can be suitable for the Suggestion category.

## Format

Bug reports should be as streamlined as possible to make it as easy as possible to review them, not only for the moderators but first of all for the developers dealing with those bugs. Irrelevant information, such as personal stories, unrelated links, images or video parts, should be avoided.

> **Relevant information:**
> 
> *When executing the `run` command, my computer freezes.*

> **Irrelevant information:**
>
> *I use this app everyday for years now and I am really very happy with it. Today I want to show you something I discovered in the App and I think it is a bug.*

A bug report needs to provide the following information (only):

- a short but appropriate description of the bug
- an appropriate demonstration of the bug (screenshot, gif, video)
- version numbers of used software (browser, operating system, drivers, etc.)

The only exception for additional information is a suggested solution to the problem.

A GIF or a video is not always necessary. In many cases a simple screenshot is enough and sometimes even a screenshot can't help to explain a bug better than the description does.
However, as soon as there's visual content included, it should contain only the minimal information and not leak personal or other irrelevant information.

### Issues on GitHub

Since the contributor needs to be connected to GitHub and Utopian automatically posts approved bug reports in the repository's issue tracker, it is important to ensure the quality, correctness and uniqueness of each contribution. Many project owners will have their first contact with Utopian in their issue tracker on GitHub.

### Reproducing Bugs

To make sure a bug report is valid, it is important to reproduce the bug if possible. It might not always be possible to reproduce a bug in a reasonable amount of time. In this case the bug report can still be accepted, if the report shows authentic visual proof of the bug.

However, thanks to the [partnership with Browserstack](https://steemit.com/@utopian-io/utopian-is-expanding-collaboration-with-browserstack-crowdin-disasterhack-and-more), we have access to a lot of different (remote-controlled) devices and operating systems to authentically check bug reports in different environments.
